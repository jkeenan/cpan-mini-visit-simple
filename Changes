Revision history for Perl module CPAN::Mini::Visit::Simple

0.016 Mon Nov 20 19:46:04 EST 2017
    - visit() internals modified to pass an absolute path to the
      action coderef.  This should provide more flexibility in
      constructing such coderefs, but have no significant impact
      on existing code.

0.015 Fri Feb 10 08:27:21 EST 2017
    - Further path separator corrections, made with great assistance
      from Charlie Gonzalez.

0.014 Wed Feb  8 22:16:32 EST 2017
    - Canonicalize one path to make path separators behave correctly
      on Windows.

0.013 Mon Jan 23 13:26:40 EST 2017
    - Add 1 example program.  Some code cleanup.
    - No change in functionality.

0.012 Fri Jan 20 23:21:45 EST 2017
    - Try to make path separators behave correctly on Windows.
    - No change in functionality.

0.011 Thu Jan 19 22:27:26 EST 2017
    - Revert to preferring binaries; much faster, fewer warnings.
    - No change in functionality.

0.010 Thu Jan 19 20:00:17 EST 2017
    - Functionality:  do not include tarballs under minicpan/modules/ in list
      of files to be traversed.
    - Implementation: move to Archive::Extract v0.80.  Create temporary
      directories during visit() with File::Temp::newdir() rather tempdir();
      newdir() appears to be faster.  Do not prefer binaries; prefer Perl
      versions.
    - Correct and improve documentation, especially for
      identify_distros_from_derived_list().

0.009 Sun Jul 12 17:55:29 EDT 2015
    - More thorough cleanup of temporary directories.

0.008 Mon Mar  9 20:37:34 EDT 2015

    - Adjusts tests to fail more gracefully in situations reported by CPAN
      testers.

    - Revise Makefile.PL to add metadata.

0.005 Sat Mar  7 19:09:12 EST 2015
    - Accommodate testing where no minicpan is installed
